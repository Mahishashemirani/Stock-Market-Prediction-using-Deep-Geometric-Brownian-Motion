# Stock-Market-Prediction-using-Deep-Geometric-Brownian-Motion

This repository explores the application of **Deep Learning** combined with **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** to model and predict stock prices. The project introduces an extension of GBM by incorporating an **alpha-stable noise term**, aiming to better capture rare, extreme events in stock price dynamics.

## Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) for Stock Market Predictions

**Geometric Brownian Motion** is a stochastic process widely used in modeling stock prices and financial markets. The GBM model expresses stock prices as a continuous-time stochastic process, defined by the following differential equation:


$dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t$

where:
- $\( S_t \)$ is the stock price at time \( t \).
- $\( \mu \)$ represents the **drift**, or the expected return rate.
- $\( \sigma \)$ represents the **volatility** of the stock.
- $\( W_t \)$ is a **Wiener process** (or Brownian motion), responsible for introducing random fluctuations.

In this model, **future price changes** are influenced by both a deterministic drift $(\( \mu \))$ and a random noise component scaled by volatility $(\( \sigma \))$, making it a powerful tool for capturing **basic price dynamics** over time.  

This equation can be solved and the solutions is:  
$S_t = S_0 \exp\(\(\mu - \frac{\sigma ^ 2}{2} \)t + \sigma W_t\)$  


GBM is widely used in financial modeling because:
1. It assumes **log-normal distribution** of stock prices, aligning with the historical tendency of stock prices to be positive and skewed.
2. It captures the **random walk behavior** observed in stock prices, which often exhibit volatility and unpredictable fluctuations in the short term.

## Limitations of GBM in Accounting for Rare Events

While GBM effectively models standard market fluctuations, it falls short in representing **rare events** or **extreme price movements** (e.g., market crashes or sudden spikes). This limitation arises from the Wiener process, $\( W_t \)$, which assumes **normal (Gaussian) distribution** of returns.

- **Normal distribution** implies that extreme deviations are highly improbable. In practice, however, financial markets often experience events that are far more extreme than what a normal distribution would predict.
- **Thin tails** of the Gaussian distribution underrepresent the probability of rare events, making GBM less effective in capturing **high-risk, high-impact events** seen in real-world markets.

## Extending GBM with an Alpha-Stable Noise Term

To address the limitations of the Gaussian noise term, this project proposes an alternative noise model: **alpha-stable noise**.

### Why Alpha-Stable Distributions?

**Alpha-stable distributions** are a family of probability distributions characterized by their **heavy tails**, allowing them to model extreme events more effectively than Gaussian distributions. An alpha-stable distribution can capture a **higher likelihood of extreme deviations**, offering a more realistic representation of stock returns.

By replacing the Wiener process $\( W_t \)$ with an **alpha-stable noise term**, the stock price dynamics become:

$dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dL_t^\alpha$

where:
- $\( L_t^\alpha \)$ is an **alpha-stable Lévy process** with stability parameter $\( \alpha \)$.
- **When $\( \alpha \leq 2 \)$**, the distribution captures **heavier tails** than a Gaussian, allowing for a higher frequency of extreme changes.

This modified model introduces **flexibility in the noise component** of the price dynamics, enabling it to better reflect **non-Gaussian behaviors** observed in markets, such as **fat tails** and **volatility clustering**. These features are essential for realistic stock market prediction, as they account for the **higher-than-expected probability of large price swings** that occur in real financial markets.

## Deep Learning Extension of Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)

To enhance the flexibility of the **Geometric Brownian Motion model**, this project introduces a **neural network-based approach** to approximate stock price dynamics. Inspired by the analytical solution of the GBM, the stock price $\( S_t \)$ is given by:

$S_t = S_0 \exp \left( (\mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2})t + \sigma W_t \right)$

In our approach, we modify this solution by incorporating a **neural network model**. Instead of directly calculating $\( S_t \)$ based on drift and volatility, we approximate it as follows:

$S_t = \exp \left( f(S_{t-1}) + \eta_t \right)$

where:
- $\( f(S_{t-1}) \)$ is a **neural network** function applied to the previous time step’s price, capturing **both linear and nonlinear interactions** in price evolution.
- $\( \eta_t \)$ represents an **alpha-stable noise term** that introduces heavy-tailed behavior, modeling rare events more effectively than Gaussian noise.

### Neural Network Structure for \( f(S_{t-1}) \)

The neural network function $\( f(S_{t-1}) \)$ combines:
1. A **nonlinear neural network** layer to capture **complex interactions and dependencies** in stock price behavior.
2. A **linear layer** to retain **linear dynamics** typical in financial time series.

This combined structure enables the model to capture both **traditional linear trends** and **nonlinear effects** present in financial data, improving its ability to model realistic price movements.

### Alpha-Stable Noise and Parameter Estimation

To account for rare events, we replace the standard Wiener process with an **alpha-stable noise term**, $\( \eta_t \)$, characterized by its **heavy-tailed** nature. An alpha-stable distribution has four parameters:
- **Stability $(\( \alpha \))$** and **skewness $(\( \beta \))$**: These are approximated directly as constants, based on the nature of the data.
- **Mean $(\( \mu_t \))$** and **scale $(\( \sigma_t \))$**: These are modeled as functions of the previous price $\( S_{t-1} \)$ using a **neural network** $\( g(S_{t-1}) \)$ such that:


$\mu_t, \sigma_t = g(S_{t-1})$

This setup allows the model to learn time-dependent adjustments to the mean and scale of the noise, adapting dynamically to market conditions.

### Summary

In this deep learning framework:
1. **Price dynamics** are approximated by combining nonlinear and linear interactions in the network function $\( f(S_{t-1}) \)$.
2. **Heavy-tailed noise** is introduced through an alpha-stable noise term $\( \eta_t \)$, allowing the model to account for rare events.
